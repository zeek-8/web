                <p id="paragraph-1" class="paragraph">Joan of Arc (French: Jeanne d'Arc pronounced [ʒan daʁk]; c. 1412 – 30 May 1431) is a patron saint of France, honored as a defender of the French nation for her role in the siege of Orléans and her insistence on the coronation of Charles VII of France during the Hundred Years' War. Claiming to be acting under divine guidance, she became a military leader who transcended gender roles and gained recognition as a savior of France.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Whistlejacket is an oil-on-canvas painting from about 1762 by the British artist George Stubbs showing the Marquess of Rockingham's racehorse approximately at life-size, rearing up against a plain background. The canvas is large, lacks any other content except some discreet shadows, and Stubbs has paid precise attention to the details of the horse's appearance. It has been described in The Independent as "a paradigm of the flawless beauty of an Arabian thoroughbred".</p>

                <p class="paragraph">The Morning is an 1808 painting by German artist of the Romantic era Philipp Otto Runge (1777-1810). Runge was one of the most important of the German Romantic painters, along with Caspar David Friedrich, despite his short life and The Morning is a wonderful example of this. Not only was he an artist but he also developed an interest in the then young discipline of colour theory.</p>
